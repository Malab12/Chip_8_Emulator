# Chip_8_Emulator
My Implementation of a simple Chip-8 emulator, capable of playing tetris and other ROMS

Technically the CHIP-8 was never a real machine at all but instead a virtual machine. People would write programs for this virtual machine, and then an interpreter would decode the instructions. Because it was virtual, the same programs could run on different machines as long as they had an interpreter. What we're going to create is actually one of those interpreters, but we'll just consider it an emulator.
